# Security Policy

The Cosmos ecosystem believes that strong security is a blend of highly technical security researchers who care about security and the forward progression of the ecosystem and the attentiveness and openness of Cosmos core contributors to help continually secure our operations.

> **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT open public issues on this repository for security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Any dependent Cosmos-SDK versions which are still maintained upstream will be supported in this repository. The team will continue to accept patches from the community for legacy and unsupported versions of the software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[security@strange.love](mailto:security@strange.love)**. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity.

# Guidelines

We require that all researchers:
- Abide by this policy to disclose vulnerabilities, and avoid posting vulnerability information in public places, including GitHub, Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.
- Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems (including but not limited to networks using the affected software), and destruction of data.
- Keep any information about vulnerabilities that youâ€™ve discovered confidential between yourself and the engineering team until the issue has been resolved and disclosed.
- Avoid posting personally identifiable information, privately or publicly.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:
- Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research on this vulnerability
- Work with you to understand, resolve and ultimately disclose the issue in a timely fashion
